                        I am a friendly, charmismatic people person. My personal philosophy is 
                        to form as many meaningful<br>
                        connections as possible while leaving a positive impact on the world around me. <br>
                        I have been working for the last 14 years in several different fields. I have my own <br>
                        small business as a performing magician and master of ceremonies. <br>
                        <br>
                        I am extremely passionate and motivated. I believe one of my strongest skills is my <br>
                        desire to always keep learning.
